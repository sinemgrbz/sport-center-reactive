# Sport Center Project (React)

This Sport Center Project is my first web application built with React, transitioning from my original version developed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application provides features that help users improve their fitness journey, such as a Body Mass Index (BMI) calculator. The React version offers a more dynamic and efficient user experience by utilizing component-based architecture.

## Features

- BMI Calculator: Users can enter their height and weight to calculate their Body Mass Index.
- Responsive Design: The application is designed to be fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
- Dynamic UI: The user interface is now more interactive and faster due to React's virtual DOM and state management.


## Technologies Used
- **React**: Used for building the UI components and managing state.
- **HTML (JSX)**: For structuring the components in React.
- **CSS**: Used for styling the page.
- **JavaScript**: For implementing the BMI calculation functionality and enhancing user interaction.
